# Website_tutorial
Small website to show how to use Dash.

The idea of this tutorial is to go from the website that can be found [here](https://website-tutorial-4mfjnp4fjq-uc.a.run.app/) to the same website with an additionnal page to present the scores. The website with the scores should look like [this](https://answer---website-tutorial-4mfjnp4fjq-uc.a.run.app/). The code for this website can be found in the branch [answer](https://github.com/theovincent/website_tutorial/tree/answer).

## Steps to follow:
### 1. Fork the reposity
### 2. Understand the website structure
### 3. Build the package in editable mode with the development requirements
### 4. Configure the aws cli and add your credentials
### 5. Add an extra page on the website showing the score
### 6. Publish the website online with Google Cloud Run

If using Visual Studio Code, you can use the [.devcontainer](./.devcontainer) folder to work in a container.
